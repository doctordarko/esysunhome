## ⚠️ Important: Firmware Requirement

**Version 2.x requires newer ESY battery firmware with MQTT support.**

The ESY web portal has information about the firmware that your inverter is using, you can also just try the integration.. if you're not seeing data in one then its likely you have the other.

## Features

- **Real-time updates** via MQTT (fast refresh)
- **Mode control** - Change operating modes from Home Assistant
- **Comprehensive sensors** - Power, energy, battery status, temperatures
- **Secure connection** - mTLS authentication

## Sensors

| Category | Sensors |
|----------|---------|
| **Power** | PV Power, DC PV, AC PV (CT2), Battery, Grid, Load |
| **Battery** | SOC, SOH, Voltage, Current, Status, Charging/Discharging Power |
| **Energy** | Daily/Total Generation, Consumption, Grid Export, Battery Charge/Discharge |
| **System** | Grid Voltage/Frequency, Inverter Temperature, Operating Mode |

## Mode Control

Control your battery mode directly from Home Assistant:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Regular Mode | Normal self-consumption |
| Emergency Mode | Charge from grid (storm prep) |
| Electricity Sell Mode | Maximize grid export |
| Battery Energy Management | Server-side scheduling |

Configure API or direct MQTT mode changes in the integration options.
